Social Network Analysis Guide
======
Monk parakeets are highly social and form individualized relationships with members of their colony. This means that the presence, context, and strength of the relationship varies between pairs, or dyads. I use social network analysis (SNA) to visually represent parakeets (via nodes) their relationships (via edges that connect nodes) with others. SNA is a useful tool for me to analyze affiliative relationships, and I've quickly realized how overwhelming jumping to to SNA can be!

Thankfully there are tons of resources available to anyone looking to learn SNA, but it's difficult to sort through tons of tutorials, websites, and books. Especially, if you're new to coding. **My goal is to compile helpful SNA resources that I have come across as I learn SNA as a novice coder.** Hopefully, you will find this repository useful no matter what stage of coding you are at!

_if you know of any helpful resources that I have missed, feel free to email me!_

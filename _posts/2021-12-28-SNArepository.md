Social Network Analysis Repository
======
Monk parakeets are highly social and form individualized relationships with members of their colony. This means that the _presence, context, and strength_ of the relationship varies between pairs, or **dyads**. I use **social network analysis (SNA)** to visually represent parakeets (via **nodes**) their relationships (via **edges** that connect nodes) with others. SNA is a useful tool to analyze affiliative relationships, but I've quickly realized how overwhelming jumping to to SNA can be!

Thankfully there are tons of resources available to anyone looking to learn SNA, but it's difficult to sort through tons of tutorials, websites, and books designed for different audiences in mind. This can be espeically difficult to navigate if you're new to coding! **My goal is to compile helpful SNA resources that I have come across as I learn SNA as a novice coder.** Hopefully, you will find this repository useful no matter what stage of coding you are at!

_If you know of any helpful resources that I have missed, feel free to email me!_ 

You can also find a table of my posts!

| [Dia Shizuka's blog](https://dshizuka.github.io/networkanalysis/index.html)    |  blog, tutorials, example code, R  | Beginner | Dr. Shizuka's website is one of my favorites! I reference his blog all the time. He created his blog as a graduate student learning to code, so it covers all the basics. It has everything a beginnger would need - easy to digest explanations, tutorials, and example code to work with. |
| [Igraph R tutorial](https://igraph.org/r/)  | R documentation, examples, manual, plotting tutorials  | Beginner | igraph is a useful R package for plotting networks! You can follow this link for details about igraph.  |

| [5 step framework](http://www.claireloconnell.com/posts/framework/)    | notes | Beginner | I present my 5 step framework for how I approach data analysis. I work through an example of I would import, clean, wrangle, summarize, and plot data. |
| [What I learned teaching R](http://www.claireloconnell.com/posts/lessons-learned)    | notes   | Beginner  | I talk about what I learned about teaching coding in R as I learn how to code in R. I give some advice for anyone looking to start coding. |
|[ R packages and functions](http://www.claireloconnell.com/posts/2021/12/functionsandpackages/) | notes | Beginner | I share my way of thinking about functions, packages, and writing code. This post isn't necessarily a tutorial, rather a different perspective for anyone struggling to understand how R works. I hope this post will help you better understand the language. |

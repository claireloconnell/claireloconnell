I am interested in the relationship between cognition and sociality in animal socieites. An individual's perception of their social environment and/or what they know about their group members informs their social decisions. I am investigating the role of affiliation and social support in forming and maintaining social structure in monk parakeets. I want to know what information about monk parakeet affiliative relationships are important and how their relationships may influence future social decisions. With robust experiments, we can understand what social infomration individuals are paying attention to and what aspects of their relationships, like context, partner identity, bond strength are important at an individual- and group-level.

Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus)
======
Monk parakeets are a medium-sized neotropical parrot native to southern Brazil, central Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and eastern Argintina. Monk parakeets gained popularity in the pet trade and, as a result of accidental and intentional releases, established breeding populations globally. Here in the U.S. they can be found in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, New York, Connecticut, and Illinois. THey are commonly found in urban areas and are generally regarded as an agricultural pest.

Monk parakeets live in highly social multi-male multi-female colonies and build communal stick nests. These nest are unique to monk parakeets and are a conerstone of their ecology and behavior. Monk parakeets diligently work year-round to maintain their nests and raise young, and stick nests may be a key factor in the monk parakeets success as an invader. Monk parakeets, particuarly new breeding pairs and fledged juvaniles, commonly build additional chambers as an extension of a central nest or build nests nearby. 

Dominance hierarchies emerge as a result of an indiviausl relative fighting ability. Through aggressive interactions between individuals that result in a winner and a loser, individuals are assigned a rank. Higher ranking indiviudals typically have priority access to resources and breeding opportunities. Monk parakeets share several hallmarks of intelligence in primates including long developmental periods and lifespans, large relative brain size, and large complex societies with highly individualized relationships (Emery 2005; Hobson and DeDeo 2015).

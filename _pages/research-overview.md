**I am investigating how monk parakeets form affiliative, or friendly, relationships and how these relationships may provide social support.** 

Not unlike most parrot (order Psittaciformes) species, monk parakeets are incredibly social. Monk parakeets typically form strong affiliative relationships with 1-2 individuals. From our observations, it is clear that these affiliative realtionships are a significant aspect of monk parakeet's social lives. They spend a lot of time perched, preening, and foraging with their preferred partner.

For many social species, the presence and strength of affiliative relationships has fitness consequences. Affiliative relationships can increase the likelihood of social support in agonistic aid ([Strauss and Holekamp 2019](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810384116)) or buffer individuals from harmful effects of social and environmental stressors ([Young et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1411450111)). However, largely due to logistical issues with studying animals in the wild, we do not yet know how these bonds are initially formed for many taxa. 

This is especially true for parrots. Generally, we know that parrots form individualized relationships, and because parrots also long-lived, they may need to maintain relationships over decades. This suggests that parrot affiliative relationships my be particularly important. 

Unfortunately many parrot species are threatened or declining as a result of habitat loss due to deforestation and poaching. These social and environmental perturbations can fracture relationships and cause social instability. This is particularly troublesome because we donâ€™t know how resilient they are to these disturbances and most of what we do know about parrot sociality comes from captive studies that might not mimic natural conditions. But, as is the case with other social species, affiliative relationships may provide social support and have consequences for social stability and social resilience.

I am exploring themes of affiliative relationship formation, social resilience, and stability in monk parakeeys by experimentally testing how monk parakeets form novel relationships and how these relationships may help monk parakeets gain or maintain rank in a dominance hierarhcy following a social disturbance.

Monk parakeets _constantly_ fight over perching spots, food, and nesting material. We record the winners and loers of these aggressive contests to quantify a dominance hierarchy which describes the relative fighting ability of group members. Typically, higher-ranking animals are better able to defend resources like food and mates.

Monk parakeets (_Myiopsitta monachus_)
======
Monk parakeets are a medium-sized neotropical parrot native to South America. They live in highly social multi-male multi-female colonies and build communal stick nests. These apartment-style nests are unique within the parrot family and are a conerstone of monk parakeet ecology and behavior. Monk parakeets work diligently year-round to maintain their nests and raise young.

You might have seen these charismatic birds flying around a city near you! Monk parakeets gained popularity in the pet trade and as a result of releases established breeding populations globally. Here in the U.S. they can be found in but are not limited to Florida, Texas, Louisiana, New York, Connecticut, and Illinois. 

They are commonly found in urban areas and while some people enjoy these gregarious, albeit noisy, parrots at their bird feeders, others are not so keen. They are generally regarded as an agricultural pest and are known to cause significant damage to power structures.

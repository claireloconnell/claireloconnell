**I am investigating how monk parakeets form affiliative, or friendly, relationships and how these relationships may provide social support.**

For many social species, the presence and strength of affiliative relationships can directly and indirectly affect individual fitness and group cohesion. Affiliative relationships can, for example, increase longevity and reproductive success ([Archie et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173677/); [Cameron et al., 2009](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0900639106); [Maldonado-Chaparro et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347221003110#bib3)), increase the likelihood of social support in agonistic aid ([Strauss and Holekamp 2019](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810384116)), improve coordination or cooperation ([Riehl & Strong 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29643212/)), or buffer individuals from harmful effects of social and environmental stressors ([Young et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1411450111); [Jacoby et al., 2010](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/4/808/249267)).

Not unlike most parrot (order Psittaciformes) species, monk parakeets are incredibly social. Monk parakeets typically form strong affiliative relationships with 1-2 individuals. From our observations, it is clear that these affiliative relationships are a significant aspect of monk parakeet's social lives. They spend a lot of time perched, preening, and foraging with their preferred partner.

However, sociality comes at a cost. Individuals, for example, are at an increased risk for disease transmission ([Weber et al., 2013](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982213011238)), or receiving aggression if the affiliation is not welcomed or occurs too suddenly, and investing time and energy into others can be costly, even lethal ([Blumstein et al., 2013](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.1934)).

Monk parakeets _constantly_ fight over perching spots, food, and nesting material. We record the winners and losers of these aggressive contests to quantify a dominance hierarchy that describes the relative fighting ability of group members.

I am interested in the relationship between cognition and sociality in animal socieites. An individual's perception of their social environment and/or what they know about their group members informs their social decisions. I am investigating the role of affiliation and social support in forming and maintaining social structure in monk parakeets. I want to know what information about monk parakeet affiliative relationships are important and how their relationships may influence future social decisions. With robust experiments, we can understand what social infomration individuals are paying attention to and what aspects of their relationships, like context, partner identity, bond strength are important at an individual- and group-level. 

Animals living in social groups must balance the costs and benefits of group-living which involves managing their social relationships. Social structures like dominance hierarchies emerge from repeated aggressive interactions between group members and can help mitigate unnecessary risk and stress as a result of competition by establishing a "pecking-order" among group members. Dominant members of a social group are typically the most aggressive and therefore gain cruical access to mates and food while submissive group-members forgo priority access to resources in exchange for group membership. Although some animals display their rank (body size or plumage coloration), some animals must assess and remember their own and others' attributes to minimize costs of conflict while maximizing their own self-interests. 

Although dominance heirarchies emphasize aggressive relationships, affiliative relationships are also important for establishing and maintaining group-living. Affiliative social relationships can increase individual fitness by reducing stress through social grooming, help provide access to resources, and be a source of agonistic aid. However, investing time and energy into relationships can be costly, so it helps to know who is a reliable partner.

So, stakes are high and there is a lot of information about group members to process. How do individuals cope? Individuals could keep a mental list of every group member, their fighting ability, and their partners and their fighting ability, but this is cognitively demanding and difficult to maintain if group membership is constantly changing. Alternatively, individuals could follow a set of cognitive "rules" or heuristics that help guide social decision-making. 

My research will investigate how and why monk parakeets form affilative relationships and what that means for group structure and stability. My research will have important implications for the cognitive processes behind relationship formation and maintenance in a cognitively sophisticated non-primate species.

Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus)
======
Monk parakeets are a small neotropical parrot species from South America although invasive populations have been succesfully establishing globally since the 1970's. Monk parakeets live in highly social multi-male multi-female colonies, and form close social bonds with one or two individuals. Monk parakeets form stable dominance hierarhcies through aggressive contests. Monk parakeets, unlike other members of the parrot family, build communal stick nests in trees where they roost and raise chicks.

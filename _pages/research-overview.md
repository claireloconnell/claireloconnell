For many social species, the presence and strength of affiliative relationships can directly and indirectly affect individual fitness and group cohesion. Affiliative relationships can, for example, increase longevity and reproductive success ([Archie et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173677/); [Cameron et al., 2009](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0900639106); [Maldonado-Chaparro et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347221003110#bib3)), increase the likelihood of social support in agonistic aid ([Strauss and Holekamp 2019](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810384116)), improve coordination or cooperation ([Riehl & Strong 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29643212/)), or buffer individuals from harmful effects of social and environmental stressors ([Young et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1411450111); [Jacoby et al., 2010](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/4/808/249267)).

**Not unlike most parrot (order Psittaciformes) species, monk parakeets are incredibly social. Monk parakeets typically form strong affiliative relationships with 1-2 individuals. From our observations, it is clear that these affiliative relationships are a significant aspect of monk parakeet's social lives. They spend a lot of time perched, allopreening (social grooming), and foraging with their preferred partner.**

Sociality comes at a cost, and animals often have to compete with the same group members they affiliate with. For example, by associating with others, individuals are at an increased risk for disease transmission ([Weber et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213011238?via%3Dihub)). Additionally, **initiating affiliation is inherently risky!** If affiliation is not welcomed or occurs too suddenly, individuals may receive aggression, and investing time and energy into others can be costly, even lethal ([Blumstein et al., 2013](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.1934)).

</figure>

**Monk parakeets _constantly_ fight over perching spots, food, and nesting material. We record the winners and losers of these aggressive contests to quantify a dominance hierarchy that describes the relative fighting ability of group members. 

Research from the Hobson Lab demonstrates that  monk parakeets' dominance rank is an outcome of past interactions and memory rather than based on individual characteristics, like relative size or badges of status ([van der Marel et al., 2023](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/34/3/457/7093242)). These results indicate that monk parakeets incorporate their previous experiences to inform future agonistic social decisions.

**Group-living animals, like monk parakeets, need to navigate complex social environments!**

## Relationship Formation
**To investigate how animals optimize their affiliative decision-making during novel relationships, we introduced known strangers (feral birds from geographically distinct sites) into a flight pen. We spent several weeks recording all spatial associations, and aggressive and affiliative interactions.**

**Monk parakeets may use a process called “testing the waters” ([Carter et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220300993)) to first develop familiarity or trust. If strangers test the waters, they should establish familiarity with low-risk, low-investment associations, like peaceful proximity, before escalating to high-risk, high-investment associations, like allopreening or allofeeding.**

Understanding how and when individuals initiate these interactions can tell us more about how monk parakeets make affiliative social decisions. 

Knowing who your group mates are, and whether they are foes, reliable friends, or unreliable friends, can be extremely helpful information to have when deciding whether to interact with them, in what context, and how often. Establishing familiarity or trust, through direct experiences ([Chaine et al., 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13128)) or indirectly through the observation of others ([Tibbets et al., 2020](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(20)30740-5)), with potential affiliative partners could be important for mitigating risks of exploitation or injury.

## Relationship Recovery
Deciding who to affiliative with, what to invest, and when can be tricky in and of itself, and stochastic demographic events, like births, deaths, immigration, and emigration, as well as daily fluctuations in group composition and size, can further exacerbate the risks of affiliating. 

Social instability can fracture existing relationships or introduce strangers. In this case, social uncertainty is high, and individuals might not have accurate or updated information about their potential partner's reliability, propensity to affiliate, or threat level in case of aggression. Without this information, the risks of affiliating may be exacerbated.


Largely due to logistical issues with studying animals in the wild, the nuances of relationship formation and recovery has been difficult to assess for many species. New technology like, customizable apps ([van der Marel et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eth.13251)), RFID readers ([Firth et al., 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.0299)), and AI detection software ([Cheema & Anand 2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_3)) in combination with robust computational tools, like social network analysis [Brask et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article/9/2/cnab001/6295425), offer an exciting opportunity to explore the social lives of animals.

Socially competent animals should optimize their affiliative social decisions based on previous experiences.

Broadly, I am interested in the relationship between **sociality and cognition** in animal socieites. In the Hobson Lab, we study **social infomration**. We aim to test what animals know about their social environments, how they gain social information, and how social information informs future social decisions. 

**I am investigating the role of affiliation and social support in forming and maintaining social structure in monk parakeets.** I am interested in understanding what individuals know about their affiliative social environment and how social information shapes future affiliative interactions.

Affiliative relationships can have substantial effects on individual fitness and group stability by reducing stress [(Young et al 2014)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1411450111) and providing agonsitic aid [(Strauss & Holekamp 2019)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1810384116). For many species, like [spotted hyenas](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1810384116#sec-3) (_Crocuta crocuta_) and [savannah baboons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347203003634?via%3Dihub) (_Papio cynocephalus_) social relationships and social support can bolster an individuals ability to gain and maintain rank within a dominance hierarchy.

There may be an interesting relationship between affiliation and aggression in monk parakeets. Not unlike most parrot species, monk parakeets are incredibly social. Living year-round with dozens of individuals means monk parakeets must manage their relationships. Monk parakeets form strong affiliative bonds with one to two individuals. They typically spend most of their time foragings, nest building, and allopreening their partner. From our observations, it is clear that these affiliative realtionships are a significant aspect of monk parakeet's social lives.

However, we do not know much about how monk parakeet affiliative relationships are formed and maintained nor how affiliative relationships may play a role in shaping dominance hierarchies. **My research aims to understand how affiliative relationships develop and the role of affiliation in monk parakeet social structure.**

With robust experiments, we can understand what social infomration individuals are paying attention to and what aspects of their relationships, like context, partner identity, bond strength are important at an individual- and group-level. 

Monk parakeets (_Myiopsitta monachus_)
======
Monk parakeets are a medium-sized neotropical parrot native to South America. They live in highly social multi-male multi-female colonies and build communal stick nests. These apartment-style nests are unique within the parrot family and are a conerstone of monk parakeet ecology and behavior. Monk parakeets work diligently year-round to maintain their nests and raise young.

Monk parakeets fight  _constantly_ over perches, food, and nesting material. We use the consistency and outcomes of fights to quantify a dominance hierarchy. Typically, higher ranking individuals have priority access over resources like food and mates.

Monk parakeets are an interesting species to study from a cognitive perspective because they share several hallmarks of intelligence in primates including long developmental periods and lifespans, large relative brain size, and large complex societies with highly individualized relationships.

You might have seen these charismatic birds flying around a city near you! Monk parakeets gained popularity in the pet trade and as a result of releases established breeding populations globally. Here in the U.S. they can be found in but are not limited to Florida, Texas, Louisiana, New York, Connecticut, and Illinois. 

They are commonly found in urban areas and while some people enjoy these gregarious, albeit noisy, parrots at their bird feeders, others are not so keen. They are generally regarded as an agricultural pest and are known to cause significant damage to power structures.

Because of their invasion status and gregarious nature, monk parakeets present an interesting opporutunity to investigate how sociality can be an important aspect to consider for population management practices. Invasion biology and conservation biology are inherently multi-faceted fields, and I believe there is much to be gained by incorporating species' socieoecology and cognitive abilities in how we approach how species spread to non-native areas and how to conserve and protect endangered species.

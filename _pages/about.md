About me
======

I joined the [Hobson Lab](http://hobsonresearch.com/) at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to explore how monk parakeets form affiliative, or friendly relationships, and explore ways in which these relationships may benefit them. Ultimately, I hope to understand if and how animals optimize their social behavior depending on their social circumstances. My long-term goal is to incorporate information about individuals' ability to form and maintain relationships into conservation management plans.

======
Coding is an essential skill for behavioral ecologists ([Theobold et al., 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1854636); [Auker & Barthelmess 2020](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3060)), but if you're like me, it's not exactly intuitive and can be overwhelming! I created a blog to compile all of the resources I use to help me learn to code, and I supplement these resources with my notes. I hope to update my blog as I learn, so it can be a helpful resource for anyone at any stage looking to learn analytical skills in R. Particularly skills for behavioral analyses like social network analysis. [Here](http://claireloconnell.github.io/posts/2021/12/SNArepository/) is a good place to start.

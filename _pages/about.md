Welcome to my website! Here you can find more information about myself and my research. 

About me!
======


I joined the [Hobson Lab](http://hobsonresearch.com/) at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to investigate the relationship between cognition and sociality and to explore different avenues for merging animal sociality and conservation and population management efforts. I am focusing on how individual's social relationships inform future social decisions, and its effect on social strucutre like dominance hierarchies.

I have been fortunate enough to travel around the U.S. to work with zoos and sanctuaries and on several cool research projects. 

   

I like to spend my free time outdoors hiking, birding, and kayaking or playing with my foster cats!

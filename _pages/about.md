About me
======

I joined the [Hobson Lab](http://hobsonresearch.com/) at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to research how monk parakeets balance the risks and benefits of interacting during affiliative relationship formation, recovery, and maintenance. This includes understanding how pairs may  minimize the risk of aggression from potential partners when initiating affiliation and how the presence and strength of affiliative ties may buffer individuals from the negative effects of social disturbances (a process called _social buffering_) or provide agonistic aid during contests.

Ultimately, I aim to better understand social processes that underlie animals' ability to flexibly adapt to dynamic environments, or _social resilience_.

My long-term goal is to help bridge the gap between behavioral ecologists and conservationists and enhance management strategies for protecting and conserving social species by applying conceptual frameworks and robust analytical tools to actionable conservation objectives. You can read more about my research interests, monk parakeets, and social behavior in conservation in my [Research Overview](https://claireloconnell.github.io/researchoverview/)

Coding is an essential skill for behavioral ecologists ([Theobold et al., 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1854636); [Auker & Barthelmess 2020](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3060)), but if you're like me, coding is not exactly intuitive and can be overwhelming! I created a [blog](https://claireloconnell.github.io/posts/) to compile all of the resources I use to help me learn to code (mostly social network analysis), and I supplement these resources with my notes. I hope to update my blog as I learn, so it can be a helpful resource for anyone at any stage looking to learn analytical skills in R. Particularly skills for behavioral analyses like social network analysis. [Here](http://claireloconnell.github.io/posts/2021/12/SNArepository/) is a good place to start.

About me
======

I joined the [Hobson Lab](http://hobsonresearch.com/) at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to explore how monk parakeets form and recover affiliative, or friendly, relationships and identify ways in which these relationships may benefit them. Ultimately, I hope to understand if and how animals optimize their social behavior depending on their social circumstances. My long-term goal is to incorporate information about individuals' ability to form and maintain relationships into conservation management plans.

I am often asked why I study affiliative social behavior. To some, I think the idea of dedicating time to understanding social drama among squabbling parrots seems odd, maybe even frivolous. But there are three main reasons why I study how birds form relationships and why social bonds matter: 

First, I have always found our own sociality incredibly fascinating. From childhood to adulthood, I found myself constantly analyzing my relationships with friends, family, and acquaintances and even their relationships with others. I often think about how I invest in them, how they invest in me, or how some relationships may be taxing. I like to think about how, as individuals, every person in my life has their way of forming, maintaining, and recovering their relationships. I think this says a lot about who they are and what they value. 

Our sociality is at the forefront of everything we do. The presence, strength, and stability of our relationships can have an immense impact on our thoughts, feelings, decisions, and health. For better or for worse, our relationships are a large part of who we are as individuals and as humans. I think that is important to keep in mind for our short-term benefit and long-term well-being. 

Second, animals offer an interesting opportunity to explore what relationships are like and their significance in a somewhat simplified way, at least for some species, and at least compared to humans. Some species form lifelong bonds, grieve for ones they've lost, groom, feed, break up, and make up with social partners. Affiliative relationships can be beneficial, cooperative, or reproductive. They can also be detrimental, even lethal. Simply put, for a lot of social species, their relationships are important. Just like our own. 

Third, I feel responsible for minimizing the negative effects we have on other species, and I am dedicated to caring for and protecting vulnerable species. I feel strongly that a better understanding of the significance and impact of social relationships is a relevant tool to help inform our conservation, protection, and sustainability practices. 

There must be a bridge between sociality and conservation, protection, and sustainability. Not only for the sake of the knowledge of ourselves and the world around us but also for the necessity of preserving the species we share the Earth with and their friends. I want to be just one part of a much larger collective dedicated to protecting and conserving species because successful conservation requires a collective of diverse perspectives, thoughts, solutions, and people. I feel that I can be part of this collective by merging my two loves: social behavior and animals.

Coding is an essential skill for behavioral ecologists ([Theobold et al., 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1854636); [Auker & Barthelmess 2020](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3060)), but if you're like me, it's not exactly intuitive and can be overwhelming! I created a blog to compile all of the resources I use to help me learn to code, and I supplement these resources with my notes. I hope to update my blog as I learn, so it can be a helpful resource for anyone at any stage looking to learn analytical skills in R. Particularly skills for behavioral analyses like social network analysis. [Here](http://claireloconnell.github.io/posts/2021/12/SNArepository/) is a good place to start.

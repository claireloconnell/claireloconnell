_**Welcome to my website! Here you can find more information about myself and my research.**_

About me
======

I joined the [Hobson Lab](http://hobsonresearch.com/) at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to explore how monk parakeets form and recover affiliative or friendly relationships and identify how individuals may benefit them. Ultimately, I aim to understand if and how animals optimize their social investments depending on their social circumstances. My long-term goal is to incorporate information about individuals' ability to form and maintain relationships into conservation management plans.

======
Coding is an essential skill for behavioral ecologists ([Theobold et al., 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2020.1854636); [Auker & Barthelmess 2020](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.3060)), but if you're like me, coding is not exactly intuitive and can be overwhelming! I created a blog to compile all of the resources I use to help me learn to code, and I supplement these resources with my notes. I hope to update my blog as I learn, so it can be a helpful resource for anyone at any stage looking to learn analytical skills in R. Particularly skills for behavioral analyses like social network analysis. [Here](http://claireloconnell.github.io/posts/2021/12/SNArepository/) is a good place to start.

If you have any suggestions, would like to see particular content, or would like to contribute yourself, feel free to reach out! You can find my email and X (formerly Twitter) on the left!

Welcome to my website! Here you can find more information about myself and my research. 

About me!
======

I have always loved animals, and I grew increasinly intrigued by their behavior. This in combination with an interest in conservation management lead me to Mississippi State University where I graduated with a degree in Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture. During my tenure at MS state, I was fortunate enough to get to work with and study a lot of cool species like giraffes, tigers, and loggerhead sea turtles. After graduating I spent a year traveling and working on different research projects while thinking about what I wanted to focus on for my own graduate research.

I joined the Hobson Lab at the University of Cincinnati in the fall of 2020 to investigate the relationship between cognition and sociality and to explore different avenues for merging animal sociality and conservation and population management efforts. I am focusing on how individual's social relationships inform future social decisions, and its effect on social strucutres like dominance hierarchies.

I like to spend my free time outdoors hiking, birding, and kayaking or playing with my foster cats!
